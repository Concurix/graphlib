h2#alg alg
:markdown
    The `alg` modules includes a number of algorithms that can be used with the
    graph classes included in graphlib. You can either get to all algorithms
    using `var alg = require("graphlib").alg` or you can get a single
    algorithm, e.g. [`topsort`](#alg-topsort), using `var topsort =
    require("graphlib").alg.topsort`.

    For the purposes of this section, we assume the following requires:

    ```js
    var alg = require("graphlib").alg;
    ```

h3#alg-topsort alg.topsort(g)
:markdown
    An implementation of [topographical
    sorting](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Topological_sorting).

    Given a [`Digraph`](#Digraph) `g` this function returns an array of nodes
    such that for each edge `u -> v`, `u` appears before `v` in the array. If
    the graph has a cycle it is impossible to generate such a list and
    `CycleException` is thrown.

:markdown
    ```js
    alg.topsort(digraph);
    // => [ 1, 2, 3, 4 ] 
    // OR
    // => [ 1, 3, 2, 4 ] 
    ```    

h3#alg-isAcyclic alg.isAyclic(g)
:markdown
    Given a [`Digraph`](#Digraph), `g`, this function returns `true` if the
    graph has no cycles and returns `false` if it does. This algorithm returns
    as soon as it detects the first cycle. You can use
    [`alg.findCycles`](#alg-findCycles) to get the actual list of cycles in the
    graph.

    ```js
    var digraph = new Digraph();
    digraph.addNode(1);
    digraph.addNode(2);
    digraph.addNode(3);
    digraph.addEdge(null, 1, 2);
    digraph.addEdge(null, 2, 3);
    
    alg.isAcyclic(digraph);
    // => true

    digraph.addEdge(null, 3, 1);
    alg.isAcyclic(digraph);
    // => false
    ```

h3#alg-findCycles alg.findCycles(g)
:markdown
    Given a [`Digraph`](#Digraph), `g`, this function returns all nodes that
    are part of a cycle. As there may be more than one cycle in a graph this
    function return an array of these cycles, where each cycle is itself
    represented by an array of ids for each node involved in that cycle.
    [`alg.isAcyclic`](#alg-isAcyclic) is more efficient if you only need to
    determine whether a graph has a cycle or not.

    ```js
    var digraph = new Digraph();
    digraph.addNode(1);
    digraph.addNode(2);
    digraph.addNode(3);
    digraph.addEdge(null, 1, 2);
    digraph.addEdge(null, 2, 3);
    
    alg.findCycles(digraph);
    // => []

    digraph.addEdge(null, 3, 1);
    alg.findCycles(digraph);
    // => [ [ 3, 2, 1 ] ]

    digraph.addNode(4);
    digraph.addNode(5);
    digraph.addEdge(null, 4, 5);
    digraph.addEdge(null, 5, 4);
    alg.findCycles(digraph);
    // => [ [ 3, 2, 1 ], [ 5, 4 ] ]
    ```

h3#alg-dijkstra alg.dijkstra(g, source, [weightFunc], [incidentFunc])
:markdown
    This function is an implementation of [Dijkstra's algorithm][] which finds
    the shortest path from `source` to all other nodes in `g`. This
    function returns a map of `u -> { distance, predecessor }`. The distance
    property holds the sum of the weights from `source` to `u` along the
    shortest path or `Number.POSITIVE_INFINITY` if there is no path from
    `source`. The predecessor property can be used to walk the individual
    elements of the path from `source` to `u` in reverse order.
    
    It takes an optional `weightFunc(e)` which returns the weight of the edge
    `e`. If no weightFunc is supplied then each edge is assumed to have a
    weight of 1. This function throws an `Error` if any of the traversed edges
    have a negative edge weight.  

    It takes an optional `incidentFunc(u)` which returns the ids of all edges
    incident to the node `u` for the purposes of shortest path traversal. By
    default this function uses the `g.outEdges` for Digraphs and
    `g.incidentEdges` for Graphs.
    
    It takes `O((|E| + |V|) * log |V|)` time.

    alg.dijkstra(digraph, "A", weight);
    // => { A: { distance: 0 },
    //      B: { distance: 6, predecessor: 'C' },
    //      C: { distance: 4, predecessor: 'A' },
    //      D: { distance: 2, predecessor: 'A' },
    //      E: { distance: 8, predecessor: 'F' },
    //      F: { distance: 4, predecessor: 'D' } }
    ```

h3#alg-dijkstraAll alg.dijkstraAll(g, [weightFunc], [incidentFunc])
:markdown
    This function finds the shortest path from each node to every other
    reachable node in the graph. It is similar to
    [`alg.dijkstra`](#alg-dijkstra), but instead of returning a single-source
    array, it returns a mapping of of `source -> alg.dijksta(g, source,
    weightFunc, incidentFunc)`.
    
    This function takes an optional `weightFunc(e)` which returns the
    weight of the edge `e`. If no weightFunc is supplied then each edge is
    assumed to have a weight of 1. This function throws an Error if any of
    the traversed edges have a negative edge weight.
    
    This function takes an optional `incidentFunc(u)` which returns the ids of
    all edges incident to the node `u` for the purposes of shortest path
    traversal. By default this function uses the `outEdges` function on the
    supplied graph.
    
    This function takes `O(|V| * (|E| + |V|) * log |V|)` time.

h3#alg-floydWarshall alg.floydWarshall(g, [weightFunc], [incidentFunc])
:markdown
    This function is an implementation of the [Floyd-Warshall algorithm][],
    which finds the shortest path from each node to every other reachable node
    in the graph. It is similar to [`alg.dijkstraAll`](#alg-dijkstraAll), but
    it handles negative edge weights and is more efficient for some types of
    graphs. This function returns a map of `source -> { target -> { distance,
    predecessor }`. The distance property holds the sum of the weights from
    `source` to `target` along the shortest path of `Number.POSITIVE_INFINITY`
    if there is no path from `source`. The predecessor property can be used to
    walk the individual elements of the path from `source` to `target` in
    reverse order.
    
    This function takes an optional `weightFunc(e)` which returns the
    weight of the edge `e`. If no weightFunc is supplied then each edge is
    assumed to have a weight of 1.
    
    This function takes an optional `incidentFunc(u)` which returns the ids of
    all edges incident to the node `u` for the purposes of shortest path
    traversal. By default this function uses the `outEdges` function on the
    supplied graph.
    
    This algorithm takes O(|V|^3) time.

h3#alg-tarjan alg.tarjan(g)
:markdown
    This function is an implementation of [Tarjan's algorithm][] which finds
    all [strongly connected components][] in the directed graph **g**. Each
    strongly connected component is composed of nodes that can reach all other
    nodes in the component via directed edges. A strongly connected component
    can consist of a single node if that node cannot both reach and be reached
    by any other specific node in the graph. Components of more than one node
    are guaranteed to have at least one cycle.
    
    This function returns an array of components. Each component is itself an
    array that contains the ids of all nodes in the component.

    tree as an undirected graph. This algorithm is derived from the description
    in "Introduction to Algorithms", Third Edition, Cormen, et al., Pg 634.
    
    This function takes a `weightFunc(e)` which returns the weight of the edge
    `e`. It throws an Error if the graph is not connected.

h3#alg-preorder alg.preorder(g, root, callback)
:markdown
    This function performs a [preorder traversal][] of the graph `g` starting
    at the node `root`. For each node visited, `u`,  the function `callback(u)`
    is called. If the graph is a directed graph or if it does not represent a
    tree structure, the function will throw an error. In the latter case, some
    nodes may be visited before it is determined that the graph is not a tree.
